## About the project 💻 
In Nebula, the user will have an interplanetary experience! 🪐

Have you ever thought about how gravity of other planets works?
Or have you ever thought about what it would be like to collide with something on another planet?
And finally, have you ever thought about how would be like to play basketball 🏀 at a far away planet?

That is what you will have of experience in Nebula, an app for you to simulate this things in three of our solar system planets, and simulate for a new planet which you will create it!

So be creative and test it out! ✒️
