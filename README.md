## About the project 💻 
In Nebula, the user will have an interplanetary experience! 🪐

Have you ever thought about how gravity of other planets works?
Or have you ever thought about what it would be like to collide with something on another planet?
And finally, have you ever thought about how would be like to play basketball 🏀 at a far away planet?

That is what you will have of experience in Nebula, an app for you to simulate this things in three of our solar system planets, and simulate for a new planet which you will create it!

So be creative and test it out! ✒️

## Development 👩🏻‍💻

I developed this app so that people could learn more physics concepts and apply them to some planets in our solar system.

Bringing some forms of simulation, like gravity, collision and impulse, and information about Earth, Mercury and Jupiter, in addition to the possibility of creating a planet with your chosen information

This is to bring the concept of tangential learning into the realm of technology using Swift.

## Frameworks 📚
This app was built using SwiftUI for interface and navigation 👩🏻‍💻, SpriteKit for the simulations 🕹️ and SceneKit for the 3d model planet 🪐!

## How to play 📱
```
# Clone this repositorie 
$ git clone https://github.com/CynaraCosta/NebulaWWDC2023.git
```
 Or just download the project and open it in xcode and select the "play" symbol or press "command + R" which will launch the project! 
 For better exeperience, use the iPad Pro (11-inch) (4th generation) simulator.
